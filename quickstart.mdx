# Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk you through creating your first JSON API endpoint with Pulpminer. In just a few minutes, you'll be able to transform any webpage into a structured JSON API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Pulpminer account (sign up at pulpminer.com)
- The URL of a webpage you want to convert to an API
- Some credits in your account (new accounts start with free credits)

## Step 1: Access the Dashboard

1. Sign in to your Pulpminer account
2. Navigate to the API Generation page
3. You'll see the main interface with a URL input field

## Step 2: Generate JSON from a Webpage

1. Enter your target webpage URL in the input field
2. Select a scraper (scraper 1, scraper 2, etc.) from the dropdown menu
   - Each scraper is optimized for different types of webpages
   - Try different scrapers to find the one that works best for your page
3. Click "Generate JSON from webpage content"
4. Wait a few seconds while our AI analyzes the page
5. Review the generated JSON structure in the editor

<Note>
The AI will automatically identify and extract key information from the webpage using your selected scraper. You can customize this structure in the next step.
</Note>

## Step 3: Customize the JSON Structure (Optional)

1. Use the interactive JSON editor to modify the structure
2. Add or remove fields as needed
3. Rearrange data to match your requirements
4. Preview the changes in real-time

<Tip>
If you're happy with the AI-generated structure, you can skip this step and proceed to saving your API.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Configure API Settings

1. Under "Saving Options", decide if you want to enable caching:
   - **Enabled**: Faster responses, data updated every 15 minutes
   - **Disabled**: Real-time data, fresh content on every request

2. Configure session state (only available with Scraper 1):
   - **Use Session**: Establishes a session with the origin URL before connecting to the target URL. Useful for .gov websites and domains that require session authentication
   - **No Session**: Uses a fresh connection for each request

3. Optionally enable dynamic variables:
   - Toggle the "Enable Dynamic Variables" switch
   - Define variable names for URL path segments and query parameters
   - Preview how your dynamic URL will look with the variables

4. Click "Save as API" to create your endpoint

## Step 5: Get Your API Key

1. Go to the API Keys section
2. Copy your unique API key
3. Keep this key secure - you'll need it for all API requests

## Step 6: Use Your New API

### For Static APIs (without dynamic variables):

Your API endpoint will be in this format:
```bash
GET https://api.pulpminer.com/external/{api_id}
```

To make a request:
```bash
curl -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.pulpminer.com/external/{api_id}
```

### For Dynamic APIs (with variables):

Your API endpoint will be in this format:
```bash
POST https://api.pulpminer.com/external/{api_id}
```

To make a request with dynamic variables:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variableName1": "value1", "variableName2": "value2"}' \
  https://api.pulpminer.com/external/{api_id}
```

<Warning>
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key and `{api_id}` with the ID of your saved API.
</Warning>

## Understanding Credit Usage

Each action uses credits:
- Generating JSON: 0.25 credits
- API endpoint request: 0.4 credits

Monitor your credit usage in the dashboard to ensure uninterrupted service.
