# Caching

Pulpminer's caching system helps you optimize performance and reduce costs by storing and reusing webpage data. This guide explains how caching works and how to use it effectively.

## How Caching Works

When you enable caching for an API endpoint:

1. **First Request**
   - Data is fetched from the source webpage
   - The JSON response is stored in cache
   - The timestamp is recorded

2. **Subsequent Requests**
   - If cached data is less than 15 minutes old:
     - Returns cached data immediately
   - If cached data is older than 15 minutes:
     - Returns cached data
     - Triggers a background refresh
     - Updates cache for future requests

## Enabling Cache

You can enable caching when saving a new API:

1. Generate your JSON from a webpage
2. Review and customize the JSON structure
3. Check the "Cache Content" toggle before saving
4. Click "Save as API"

## Cache Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enabled | Uses cached data with background refresh |
| Disabled | Always fetches fresh data |

## Benefits of Caching

### 1. Faster Response Times
- Immediate responses from cache
- No waiting for webpage scraping
- Reduced latency

### 2. Cost Efficiency
- Same credit cost per request
- Better performance for the same price
- More efficient resource usage

### 3. Reliability
- Cached data available even if source is down
- Background refresh reduces failures
- Consistent response times

## When to Use Caching

### Best for:
- Static content that rarely changes
- High-traffic API endpoints
- Non-time-critical data
- Backup data availability

### Not recommended for:
- Real-time data requirements
- Rapidly changing content
- Time-sensitive information
- Critical up-to-the-second updates

## Cache Refresh

### Automatic Refresh
- Occurs when data is older than 15 minutes
- Happens in the background
- Doesn't affect response time
- Updates cache for next request

### Manual Refresh
- Delete and recreate the API endpoint
- Forces a fresh data fetch
- Resets the cache timer

## Monitoring Cache Status

In your API dashboard, you can see:
- Last fetch time for each endpoint
- Cache status (enabled/disabled)
- Next refresh time

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Wisely**
   - Enable caching for stable content
   - Disable for real-time requirements
   - Consider your use case needs

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Watch response times
   - Check data freshness
   - Adjust settings as needed

3. **Optimize Usage**
   - Group similar data needs
   - Use consistent cache settings
   - Plan for scale

## Example Scenarios

### News Website API
```json
{
  "cache": false,  // Disable cache for latest news
  "url": "https://news-site.com/latest",
  "jsonFormat": {
    "headlines": [],
    "articles": []
  }
}
```

### Company Info API
```json
{
  "cache": true,   // Enable cache for stable content
  "url": "https://company.com/about",
  "jsonFormat": {
    "name": "",
    "description": "",
    "team": []
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stale Data**
   - Check if cache is enabled
   - Verify last fetch time
   - Consider disabling cache

2. **Slow Responses**
   - Confirm cache status
   - Check source webpage
   - Monitor system status

3. **Cache Not Updating**
   - Verify 15-minute threshold
   - Check for errors
   - Contact support
